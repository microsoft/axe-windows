## Overview

Axe.Windows is a NuGet package for running automated accessibility tests on WindowsÂ® applications.

To get the latest version of the Axe.Windows NuGet package, visit
[Axe.Windows on NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Axe.Windows/).

### How to run automated accessibility tests

1. Create a `Config` object using `Config.Builder`.

        // Create config to specifically target a process
        var myConfigBuilder = Config.Builder.ForProcessId(1234);

        // Optional: configure to create an A11yTest file
        myConfigBuilder.WithOutputFileFormat(OutputFileFormat.A11yTest);

        // Optional: configure to output the file to a specific directory (otherwise, current directory will be used)
        myConfigBuilder.WithOutputDirectory(".\test-directory");

        // Ready to use config
        var myConfig = myConfigBuilder.build();

2. Create a `Scanner` object using the `ScannerFactory` object with the `Config`.

        // Create scanner using myConfig
        var scanner = ScannerFactory.CreateScanner(myConfig);

3. Call  the `Scan` method on the `Scanner` object.

        var scanResults;
        try
        {
            scanResults = scanner.Scan();
        }
        catch(AxeWindowsAutomationException e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(e.ToString());
        }

4. Check the results.

        Console.WriteLine("Number of errors found in scan: " + scanResults.ErrorCount);


- Use an automation test framework like [UI Automation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-overview) or [WinAppDriver](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver) to manipulate your application
- Scan your application as many times as you need to
- Axe.Windows returns results with each scan and can optionally save each scan's results to an a11ytest file you can open with [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/windows/overview)
